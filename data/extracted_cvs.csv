Experience Company Name July 2011 to November 2012 Accountant City , State Enterprise Resource Planning Office (ERO) In this position as an Accountant assigned to the Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) ERO I was responsible for identifying and resolving issues affecting the DEAMS General Ledger. I worked with teammates from the Procure to Pay, Orders to Cash, and Budget to Report areas to resolve daily challenges encountered with the deployment of DEAMS to additional customers and when system change requests were promoted to production. I supported the testing of scripts, patches, and system change requests ensuring any anomalies were identified to the DEAMS Functional Management Office for action by the DEAMS Program Management Office and/or the System Integrator. In addition, I served on a tiger team designed to identify and resolve General Ledger posting differences and supported the development of $360B in accounting adjustments allowing for the first successful fiscal year-end close in 2012. These actions also allowed for the reconciliation and closure of fiscal year 2010 and 2011 accounting adjustments ensuring that all DEAMS fiscal year-end requirements were completed. These actions were recognized as critical to the successful review report issued by the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) resulting in the Air Force receiving the authority to continue with the deployment of DEAMS. Company Name April 2010 to June 2011 Resource Advisor City , State In this position as Resource Advisor for the 1st Air Communications Operation Squadron (1ACOS) I was responsible for providing financial advice and decision support to the Commander. I was responsible for coordinating a $4.6M budget between four funding sources. I coordinated with USAFE Directorate of Intelligence (USAFE/A2), USAFE Directorate of Air and Space Operations (USAFE/A3), USAFE Directorate of Communications (USAFE/A6) and the 435th Air Ground Operations Wing to ensure 1ACOS meets its mission requirements. I consistently managed three separate timelines for providing budget/unfunded requirements, providing documentation and various reports in the required format for each organization. I discussed the outcome of the Group and Directorate budget meetings providing feedback the same day to the Flight Chiefs and CC any issue which affects 1ACOS directly. I monitored the Defense Travel System (DTS) daily and identify orders and authorizations needing approval and provided notification to the appropriate Reviewing Officials and Approvers. Utilizing DTS and the General Accounting and Finance System I reviewed status reports to identify anomalies in obligations and have identified those orders which require correction prior to payment. I provided Government Purchase Card (GPC) status reports the same day they are requested and in addition, communicated with the appropriate cardholders when changes were required to support their program. I identified cardholder training requirements and monitored these requirements to ensure all required training was completed in support of this mission critical program. I developed guidance for the GPC cardholders on procedures for requesting training for the squadron and in addition I provided answers to cardholder questions on unique or non-standard issues/concerns. Assumed the role of the Billing Official during my final rating period and completed a self inspection of the program for the Management Control Program, zero findings. During yearly audit by 700th CONS received zero findings. Company Name July 2008 to April 2010 Staff Accountant City , State In my position as the Staff Accountant for HQ USAFE I was responsible for providing accounting and financial oversight and advice to customers throughout the Command in support of the USAFE Comptroller. I was responsible for performing ongoing analysis of financial programs to identify negative trends and weaknesses, ensured specific weaknesses were corrected, and determined whether systemic or repeat issues were identified and adequately addressed. I was required to apply a comprehensive knowledge of analysis/reporting requirements and data produced to resolve these issues. In collaboration with DFAS Europe, developed an automated tool that identifies duplicate obligations by comparing records in the accounting system to the contracting system and provided notification to the funds manager for review and resolution. This tool eliminated hours of manual research and results allowed HQ USAFE to deobligate over $5M in duplicate obligations. I was responsible for establishing various performance metrics which ensured effective and efficient use of USAFE financial resources. I supported the USAFE/FMA Financial metrics program by collaborating with DFAS Limestone in the development of an automated tool that provided senior leaders with visibility to any USAFE unit that is not in compliance with the established rules and regulations related to the GPC. This tool provides management reports that are used to populate the monthly metric charts which are briefed by the USAFE/FMA. This tool provided the capability for USAFE/FMA to collaborate with USAFE Contracting and develop/deploy joint guidance that supports the established Air Force Instruction mandating card suspension for card holders who are not in compliance with required reservation of funds in the entitlement system in support of the GPC. I identified and resolved a problem with five GPC accounts that had been rejecting during the automated interface process each month. My research revealed that these accounts were rejecting for invalid paying station and required manual intervention by both Wing and DFAS personnel. This not only created rework, it delayed the payment of the invoices. I partnered with DFAS Denver, corrected the records in the Access On-Line accounts eliminating the error condition. I identified a method to deliver one-on-one training in support of the USAFE deployment of the Open Document Analysis (ODA) tool in FMSuite. By utilizing Defense Connect Online I provided training remotely, virtually eliminating the need to expend funds on Temporary Duty (TDY) travel. The results of this training produced results that went well above expectations and were noted by the ODA Program Management Office. Company Name January 2007 to July 2009 Chief, Reports Branch.

Limestone reorganized under the High Performing Organization (HPO) in January 2007 and at that time I was reassigned to AM&C, a Directorate which previously did not exist. My challenge during that time was to staff my branch, implement an aggressive training schedule, and ensure the continuity of financial reporting was maintained. As we transitioned into the HPO we continued defining the missions and functions for AM&C for the entire network. I participated in biweekly conference calls with Standards and Compliance in an effort to define missions and functions for AM&C. Worked with management in determining FTEs needed for the branch. I was responsible for developing meaningful performance standards for my employees since this branch and its functions did not previously exist. Limestone POC for an initiative to eliminate suspense accounts throughout the agency.

By working with the DFAS Command Client Executives and the Major Command Comptrollers, I was instrumental in forming a strategy that included soliciting Air Force personnel assistance in document processing, identification of ""must pay now"" bills, and the formation of special action response teams dedicated to responding to our customer's most urgent requirements.

This product has capability to show look-through exposure to complex instruments(e.g. pools,funds,ETF) and exotic derivative products(e.g. total return swap,index future). A game changing product being used very broadly at Wellington by our investors and clients since 2007. Designed and developed a data quality reconciliation process to detect,respond and prevent data quality issues in a production environment for a mission critical product. Delivered many quality products to production well in time and under budget with very limited number of resources and proactively took ownership to resolve complex problems faced by the team. As a result, I have achieved highest ratings ever possible by my manager for more than 10 years in a row.

My team is now working on to build IBOR+ using proprietary technology and database using HTAP architecture. As a principal architect on IBOR+, I designed data model, instrument and transaction meta-models and other key foundational components to build a highly available,reliable and optimized IBOR architecture. IBOR+ is a transaction based system to provide real-time positions,exposures and investment performance data using one unified platform. IBOR+ provides both current and historical(as-of,as-at) data in lighting speed due to very innovative and cutting edge technology.

12341902,"EDUCATION OFFICER & SENIOR EDUCATION OFFICER GUIDANCE & COUNSELING UNIT Professional Summary I joined the Ministry of Education in 1982 and was posted at the R.M.Bailey Senior High School where I remained for seventeen and a half wonderful years. I served as Head of the Guidance Department from 1991 to 1999 until my redeployment to Special Services Section to oversee the Guidance & Counseling Unit upon the retirement of the former officer. I enjoyed my experience at R.M.Baily and have had the pleasure of working with and assisting students even after my departure from the school, I am still counseling many of them and their children today. I have had the opportunity of supervising the Guidance & Counseling Unit over the past sixteen years and watched it grow from forty- two (42) counselors in 1999 to one hundred and thirty two (132) in 2015, posted in ninety-four schools on fourteen islands and cays throughout the country. During my leadership, we collaborated with the College of The Bahamas and Kent State University and established a Master's of Education Degree Program in School Counseling from 2001 to 2011. Eighty- nine (89) persons obtained the Masters Degree, and the unit has the largest amount of employees with this Degree in the Ministry of Education. I realized in order for the unit to move forward, ongoing training was a requirement for all officers, which kept them informed about the latest techniques and strengthened areas of concern. We also established a crisis team that assists with grief and disaster counseling. The needs of students were being met but those of the employees were not and after visiting the school district in Dallas Texas, I learned about the Employee Assistance Program, and implemented it at the Ministry of Education on a smaller scale. This proved to be very successful but the need for expansion was necessary. Upon the retirement of Mrs. Pansy Hamilton Brown, Iris Strachan, and Clevette Gibson took the reins and took EAP to the next level. The demands on the officers made me realize that the service needed to be made available to all government employees and the idea to expand the service was decided. I enjoyed my role as Senior Education Officer and if given the opportunity would like to be a part of taking EAP to the next level.

Proficient with MS Office suite and other work-related software. Additional Comments I have been working in the Aviation industry for 12 years now and bring with me a total on 15 years of experience that makes me a well-seasoned professional. I bring with me experience of working with commercial, military, charter, and prototype aircraft. I am experienced and knowledgeable with Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, Dornier, and Lockheed and have proven myself to be both versatile when working with various aircraft makes & customers. Experience January 2011 to Current Company Name City , State Purchaser / Production Coordinator My journey at Flightstar began with production coordinating, where I was responsible for interfacing with leads, project managers, and customer representatives regarding aircraft documentation, parts status, and any problems that may affect the delivery schedule. In this position I was responsible for aircraft paperwork and work cards during the maintenance visits. I worked one on one with purchasing to ensure the proper communication of parts that could affect aircraft delivery and help expedite these parts as necessary. When services were required either in house or items being sent out for any kind of testing or repair, I would provide complete and accurate paperwork to purchasing. Daily reporting of parts statuses, man hours, and aircraft schedule was a daily task. Being a coordinator first and already having experience in purchasing made my transition to a buyer smooth since I could now work more closely with the coordinators with each of us able to support one another better with part status updates and any paperwork issues. Like coordinators I have to interface with leads, project managers, and customer representatives. In addition I have to communicate between various departments at FAS such accounting to make sure that material is paid and billed accurately as well as quality to make sure that the parts purchase are up to standard and come from an approved source. Being on both sides of the fence I know see that coordinators spend more time corresponding between the different areas of the job where buyers spend more time on parts themselves. Purchasers are responsible for every part purchased or requested and Have the sole responsibility of resolving any materials needed. I have to not only purchase the parts but also validate the paperwork or trace is acceptable and legal. If it isn't, resolve any rejected parts by means of returns and credits. Buyers are responsible for expediting all orders and making sure that they are received as needed. We then report this information to the coordinators and project managers as necessary. Outside vendor interaction is a big part of purchasing and we have to form business relationships to effectively perform or duties. In addition I am responsible for meeting standards and performance metrics within the company to make that we are functioning at an industry standard to rise above the competition. Purchasing is also responsible for cost savings such engaging in supplier contracts and rebate programs. These savings of course benefits everyone on the company. Purchasers are a point of contact between FAS, suppliers, and customers regarding materials so effective communication and reporting is key in this position. February 2009 to December 2010 Company Name City , State Purchasing Clerk / Material Specialist Working with Vision Airlines included a lot of different responsibilities. Not only was I responsible for quoting and purchasing materials for both Aircraft and Stock, but also included Stores / Warehouse, Shipping, and Receiving responsibilities. Being a smaller Airline I work closely with the Executive staff as well as the owners of the company themselves. After receiving a Material Order Request, I would acquire the necessary quotes to find the best price and lead time available. If needed, get approval to proceed with the order. Coordinate and expedite the shipping and payment process to get the material where it needs to be in a timely manner. I would match invoice with purchase orders and track shipments to assure their arrival. Upon receipt of material, I then would verify proper certification of the material, receive into the system, and label as required. Once material is ready to be used, issue from the system to assure all records was correct. All of this required constant tracking using Excel, Word, and Adobe. I kept records of all transactions whether it was materials needing to be ordered, Purchase Orders themselves, Invoices needing to be paid, or items that that have already been received. As well as certifications and any other information requested from maintenance. If an item needed to be shipped I was responsible for the proper packaging, handling, and traceability to be done in a professional manner. As part of the AOG team I would be called on at any time to locate and facilitate the material where the urgent requirement may be. This involved having key information to acquire the material and coordinate with the proper logistics necessary. Also as a valued member of the material group I have represented the Airline at maintenance facilities to properly manage the material being ordered and used for an Aircraft. February 2005 to January 2009 Company Name City , State Purchasing Agent / Material Expeditor I started working as a Material Expeditor which required me to work closely with Purchasing, Maintenance, and the Airline. Being an Expeditor had responsibilities that could change day by day depending on what was required of me. I provided daily reports and expedited any material needed to keep the production process flowing efficiently. This meant coordinating the order and shipment process, as well as the actual delivery of the material. My responsibility as a Purchasing Agent is to find price and availability on material needed and then order and track for prompt shipment. This requires me to deal directly with the vendors and develop relationships for future business. I also retrieve any and all paperwork required, retrieving certification, submit any and all signatures necessary, and expedite the material in a timely fashion. Once I have received the material I then facilitate and expedite the flow of materials to and from various departments. I have worked with many different Airline companies as well as Military, which all have high and demanding standards to meet. With this job no two days are the same, it is a constant change with challenging obstacles. In addition to being a Buyer and Expeditor, I was responsible for doing spare Sales to sister and contract companies. This required the technique of verifying stock, quoting material, ensuring proper certification, and shipping. Between the three job functions I was constantly providing and coordinating AOG orders support. Clientlogic (DELL).

13393401,"CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER Summary of Skills Strategic Planning/Management Strong communication skills Strong credit/financial analysis skills Team builder/collaborator Sales management Negotiation skills Strong multi-tasker Project management Planning/execution Cross Functional leadership Professional Experience Chief Operating Officer June 2008 to January 2010 Company Name - City , State Recruited by the Board of Directors to become COO. Oversaw all aspects of this 35+ year old medical practice comprised of 5 freestanding radiation oncology clinics located in the South Puget Sound with 8 physicians (6 whom are owners) and 64 employees. Revenues grew from $48MM in 2008 to over $53MM in 2014. This was due to the addition of two offices (one in Gig Harbor and one in Olympia) as well as additional modalities of treatment. Achievements: Saved the company over $160,000 in 2015 due to hard negotiations with our Electronic Medical Record vendor due to poor performance. Saved the company over $120,000 annually by negotiating with the bank to lower interest rates on loans in early 2009. Brought two construction projects, one for a new clinic with a $6.5MM budget and the other for an extensive remodel with a $4.5MM budget, under budget and on time saving $200,000 in total. Brought in a consultant to successfully turn the Board Meetings into efficient, professional meetings with strict agendas, time allotments for each topic and rules of order. Prior to that, the meetings were overly lengthy, ineffective and combative. This resulted in fewer meetings, which have been far more effective. Oversaw the opening of and addition of a Urology practice as well as the first mobile Brachytherapy unit in the State of WA (for the treatment of various types of cancer). Both contributed to an increase in revenues to the company of more than $1MM annually. Successfully negotiated with two of the owners for buyouts on behalf of the Board. One was amicable and the other was contentious. This will result in cost savings to the company in excess of $1MM annually. May 1998 to May 2008 Company Name - City , State COLB was started in 1993 and has grown to an $8.5 billion dollar, 150+ branch community bank in WA, ORE and ID. Recruited by and joined as Vice President and Commercial Banker with no loan portfolio 05/1998 Through aggressive sales calls/marketing, grew portfolio to over $30MM in outstandings and $50MM in commitments in three years! This was accomplished with a consistent and active marketing plan aimed at targeting well known businesses in the area as well as utilizing a strong referral base consisting of lawyers, accountants and existing customers of the Bank. Promoted to SVP due to growth of portfolio and fee income/referrals 06/2001 Promoted to SVP and SWWA Commercial Banking Manager 06/2003 In this position, I was responsible for 8 commercial middle market lenders, whose territory stretched from Auburn to Longview, WA. While Columbia had started via a bank in Longview, it had been neglected from a commercial lending standpoint. I spent considerable time and effort in working with the lending center there to establish a robust and larger presence. Achievements: Overall TEAM portfolio grew from outstandings of $100MM to over $160MM in a highly competitive, charged environment. At one time this was the largest commercial market in the Bank (CB later entered Seattle, King County). Implemented monthly sales meetings to emphasize consistent marketing and calling efforts, both with prospects and in cross-selling to existing customers. This resulted in deposit growth within the group from $100MM to over $200MM and fee income exceeding $1,200,000 annually. Also during this time I was active in mentoring individual lenders, assisting with credit structure and pricing and calling on both prospects and existing clients. I worked hard to foster strong lines of communication and collaboration with other departments in the Bank who were our partners in business development and instrumental in our success. Was asked to join Loan Committee as a voting member. June 2005 As my credit knowledge and responsibilities had grown, I was asked and approved to sit on the Bank's loan committee. This was an opportune time to view all of the various types of credits that were presented.

13199813,"DIRECTOR OF BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT Executive Profile My goal is to use my unique collection of expertise, experience, and skills gained from my seventeen years as a construction business development and marketing representative, five years managing a sales force, six years helping my father run his historic home remodeling business, and my college education to reach my full potential as an account executive by helping Visio Financial Services achieve steady, long-term, sustainable growth by building productive relationships with customers, co-workers, company leadership, and other stakeholders. Core Accomplishments Sales and Marketing Increased income 112% in 12 months in Austin Increased market share from 20% to 70% in downtown Atlanta construction market in 12 months Designed and executed branding plan to change the image of the organization, resulting in significant market share increase in each of 23 major U.S. cities Investigated markets and target customer issues to create messaging strategy Market Research Defined industry segments and identified opportunities in 23 major U.S. cities Discovered new opportunities in mature markets and developed and led the implementation of plans to capture significant market share Account Management Managed various sized accounts and grew business by providing superb customer service Successfully grew account sizes in 23 major U.S. markets Trained local staff to continue the example of growing accounts through excellent client service Professional Experience Director of Business Development 04/2005 to 04/2015 Company Name City , State Washington, DC I was called upon to develop and implement growth initiatives in the most difficult scenarios. Whether in low market share environments or during construction recessions or a combination of both, I significantly increased market share in any city to which I was assigned. Through my leadership and supervision, I expanded our market share in Miami, Knoxville, Minneapolis, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Tulsa, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Orlando, Denver, Tucson, Houston, New Orleans, Biloxi, New York City, Indianapolis, Birmingham, Nashville, Chattanooga, Sacramento, Modesto, and Fresno. Following is a partial list of noteworthy accomplishments from those assignments: Miami - I developed relationships with building owners in downtown Miami and leveraged those relationships into a group meeting of 17 building owners representing 38 buildings. I delivered a PowerPoint presentation which led to the owners to insist that their building managers give us priority budding status on every project. This one action resulted in substantial growth for my organization. Minneapolis - Redesigned the business development program to focus on building relationships with end-users. As a result, the end-users would insist on using us on their projects. Using this approach, I was able to build enough relationships in the construction industry to experience significant growth, even during a downturn in the construction market. Austin - I took over the business development program of a unit which had steadily declined its market share. After investigating untapped opportunities, I launched an initiative to pursue a new market. The careful execution of my plan resulted in more than a doubling of business in under 12 months. The relationships built with general contractors and end-users led to expanding our market share into San Antonio, Waco, and Dallas. Denver - When I arrived in Denver, out of a list of 200 clients, only 8 were attending monthly informational and sales meetings. I repositioned the agenda away from a ""pitchy, preachy"" sales presentation to an informational, educational, and interactive format. Within three months, attendance at those meetings grew from 8 to over 90 attendees. Director of Business Development/Political Relations Director 01/1998 to 01/2005 Company Name North Carlolina, South Carolina, Georgia After only three months as a field representative in Augusta, Georgia, I was promoted to Director of Business Development covering North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. Shortly afterwards, I was also named the political director for the three states. During my tenure, I focused primarily on growing market share in Atlanta and Charlotte, leveraging client, political, and end-user relationships to grow market share by 90% in the three states, with growth over 100% in Atlanta alone. Following is a partial list of highlights from those assignments: I attended and addressed shareholder meetings of public companies in Atlanta and built personal relationships with CEO's and Directors from Suntrust Banks, Coca-Cola, Georgia Pacific, Genuine Parts (NAPA), Cousins Properties, Rollins (Orkin Pest Control), Equifax, Synovus Banks, and Georgia Power. Leveraged those relationships to secure work at projects for these companies and gained introductions to the executives of other end-users to provide even more bid opportunities. As Political Director, I endorsed and led labor and community groups to support the election of Shirley Franklin for Mayor of Atlanta, making Franklin the first female Mayor of Atlanta and the first African-American female mayor of any major city in the South. I also endorsed and served as labor liaison to Judge Denise Majette and used my contacts and influence to help her unseat Atlanta political powerhouse and multi-term United States Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney.Â Additionally, I endorsed and assisted the successful campaigns of the first Hispanic elected to the Georgia State Senate and the first Hispanic elected to the Georgia House of Representatives. Business Manager/Account Executive 01/1995 to 01/1998 Company Name State I served as an apprentice under my father until I graduated high school, and a house we rebuilt on Tradd Street in Charleston, South Carolina, was voted house of the decade in the 1980's by the Preservation Society of Charleston. During and after college, I developed my love for and honed my skills in sales and management while running local Firestone Automotive and Tire Stores and later, business-to-business direct cold-call sales for Transworld Systems, an accounts receivables solutions company.

Personal Information Lakeland College Kirtland, OH, United States Although it is not a degree for the culinary field, I have been able to apply this degree to my career and it has helped me along in my career obtain various management positions within the culinary field, which I have excelled in in my nine plus years of this profession. My goal is to one day become an executive chef and I feel at this point I will reach it one day soon. Cooking has become a strong passion of mine to where cooking jobs do not feel like jobs anymore, its more like a fun way to live my life day to day able to wake up excited to go learn new cooking skills and make people excited about visiting our restaurant, well which ever one I am working in at the time. High School Diploma: Culinary Arts (Vocational School at Beechwood High School) 2005 Charles F Brush Lyndhurst, OH, United States While attending Brush High School (My high School) I also attended Beechwood High School from my Junior year (11th Grade) to my senior Year (12th Grade) to study culinary arts where we learned the basics of cooking. I was interested in how to become a cook and how to make various dishes so I would e able to cook meals for my family at home. During high school, although I was in the Culinary Arts program, at the time it did not keep my interest, so when I graduated I got into the Business management field, while attending college I began working as a dishwasher at Houlihans and was intrigued again by working in the kitchen, so much that I was able to be promoted to prep cook and from there I started my Culinary Career. Each year they have it here in Cleveland, and if I am Available, I work at our annual Air show as a cook vendor if there is an opportunity for me. I also like to volunteer to cook for the homeless at our Cleveland Food Bank, during the holidays which I have not been able to do recently, but I do love being able to put smiles on everyone during the holidays with exceptional and delightful meals.

Here's how to choose a letter font that is professional and readable, as well as how to choose the appropriate font size for your letter. It is important to select a font that is large enough so that the reader doesn't have to squint to read your letter, but not so big that your letter doesn't fit well on a page. Use a Basic Font Using a simple font will ensure that your letter is easy to read. Basic fonts like Arial, Verdana, and Times New Roman work well. Depending on how much content you have in your letter select a 10 or 12 point font size. It's best if you can format your letter so it fits on one page. Regardless of the font size you select, there needs to be space at the top of the letter and between each paragraph and each section of your cover letter. Here's how to space your cover letter. When you are using Microsoft Word, here is how to select a font for your letter and how to select the font size. If you're using a different word processing program, the process is similar. Select the content of your cover letter then choose a font and a font size. You may need to try a couple of different sizes to make sure that your cover letter fits on a single page. How to Select a Cover Letter Font Select a font from the list at the top of your document before you start writing your letter, or: Type your cover letter. Highlight the content of your letter. Either select the font from the pop-up window or select the font from the list at the top of the document. Experience Production Associate 03/2006 to Current Company Name City , State cover letter typically accompanies each resume you send out. Your cover letter may make the difference between obtaining a job interview or having your resume ignored, so it makes good sense to devote the necessary time and effort to writing effective cover letters. A cover letter should complement, not duplicate, your resume. Its purpose is to interpret the data-oriented, factual resume and add a personal touch. A cover letter is often your earliest written contact with a potential employer, creating a critical first impression. Find out more of the differences between a resume and a cover letter. There are three general types of cover letters: The application letter which responds to a known job opening (review samples) The prospecting letter which inquires about possible positions (review samples) The networking letter which requests information and assistance in your job search (review samples) Your cover letter should be designed specifically for each purpose outlined above as well as for each position you seek. Do not design a form letter and send it to every potential employer (you know what you do with junk mail!). Effective cover letters explain the reasons for your interest in the specific organization and identify your most relevant skills or experiences (remember, relevance is determined by the employer's self-interest). The letter should express a high level of interest and knowledge about the position. Keep in mind that your cover letter doesn't need to be long - a page is plenty. Here's information on how long a cover letter should be.

It is also used to track invoices charged back to the department budget or to the various business units. The primary objective of this project was to migrate the existing application which was developed in MS-Access to a web based application by implementing security and adding additional business rules. 2) DEBTS (Daily Equity Based Tax Solution): DEBTS is a tool which is used to calculate employee tax based on certain parameters (medical, social security tax factor). It is developed for UTC USA and deals with all UTC employees' daily equity tax. UBS will place a flat file each day in SFTP with all transactions performed by the employees of UTC. The typical flat file contains employee id, country code, tax details etc. DEBTS tool will connect to SFTP and downloads flat file to perform the validation rules, at last tool will decide the record status (there are 3 statuses as Valid, Exception and Pending). User can login to the system and can review the exception records. And also user can rectify the exceptions to move the exception record to valid records and send the funding files to ADP. 3) Supplier Portal Supplier Portal is designed in SharePoint 2010 to collaborate with their authorized suppliers. Supplier Portal is a merge of seven legacy Pratt and Whitney existing applications into a single portal. The features that are available simplify the way their suppliers can access required business & technical information, as well as how they can provide P&W with valuable delivery information. It is one of the main communication portals and it plays a major role in doing business with Pratt & Whitney. Apart from SharePoint 2010, we used SQL Server 2012 and ASP.Net to develop this application. 4) eRFA (electronic Request For Agreement): RFA is an agreement between two parties (Company and Client) before they start the work. This process involved more than eight approvers to approve the agreement. The existing process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and approval status etc. The new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to capture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to validate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a web based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an ability to generate various reports required to report of export events. Apart from these features it also includes the facility of uploading bulk data into the database which needs to be validated for the correctness of the data against business rules which determine the type of data that can be uploaded into each column.

I knew right away this is something I have to be a part of, and something I'd deeply regret if I didn't try. I'm looking to really start my career and be involved with something I can grow into and invest myself in long term. I see that in the Customer Marketing Coordinator position, and couldn't be more excited for this opportunity. Before Zendesk, I was at a marketing company supporting the entire staff with demographic research for target market campaigns. I enjoyed the marketing aspect and always thought I'd find myself back in it somehow. Now, I consider myself lucky to be a part of this amazing company, I've put my best effort into everything given to me and I know Zendesk is the only place I want to be. I am responsible for coordinating every interview within the San Francisco office, greeting all candidates onsite, and maintaining an organized status database. As well as my main responsibilities, I've also managed our office expansion and filled in for administrative duties when needed. I had the pleasure of assisting in planning our Holiday Party as well as other team activities. What I love most about Recruiting is how much personable interaction there is on a daily basis with different backgrounds and different personalities. I've had the privilege of being trained to always have a poised and appropriate response to every situation, and guidelines for the utmost professionalism with every phone screen, reference call, email, or in-person interview. I recently had the opportunity to visit college campuses to promote Zendesk. I realized then how much I enjoy educating others and making them too, believe in what we do. Now that I've found the perfect company, I'm ready for the perfect position that combines everything I love and excel in; planning, coordinating and evangelizing. With my history in Marketing and my current role, I'm used to supporting an entire team and an entire company. I can manage multiple projects at once, I'm highly dependable and extremely detailed. Zendesk has made me a more passionate professional and I would love the opportunity to promote our vision for customer love. Best regards, Zendesk is looking for a Recruiting Program Associate who is ready to wear multiple hats within Recruiting. The ideal Associate will be skilled in areas of project management, event planning, vendor and university relations, budgeting, and training.
